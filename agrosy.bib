  abstract={A modified form of differential equations is proposed that describes physical processes studied in applied mathematics and mechanics. It is noted that solutions to classical equations at singular points may undergo discontinuities of the first and second kind, which have no physical nature and are not experimentally observed. When new equations describing physical fields and processes are derived, elements with finite dimensions are considered instead of infinitely small elements of the medium. Thus, classical equations include nonlocal functions averaged over the element volume and are supplemented by the Helmholtz equations establishing a relationship between nonlocal and actual physical variables, which are smooth functions having no singular points. Singular problems of the theory of mathematical physics and the theory of elasticity are considered. The obtained solutions are compared with the experimental results.},

@incollection{ClassicalMechanicalSystems,
    abstract = {Singularities in the equations of motion of a classical mechanical system usually play a dominant role in the global phase portrait of the system. By a singularity we mean a point or set of points where the system is undefined, as in the case of a collision between two or more of the particles in the n-body problem. Such singularities often lead to a complicated global orbit structure. Not only do certain solutions tend to run off the phase space, but also nearby solutions tend to behave in an erratic or unpredictable manner. Numerical studies of such systems are often inconclusive because of this erratic behavior. And power series or other analytic techniques often yield only a very local description of solutions near the singularity, one which gives no hint of the global complexity of the system.},
